I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about the increasing rage in programmers against fellow programmers on the basis of their code formatting and indentation style.
<br>
I strongly believe that editors should have an option to convert codes in between the given two most common style of indentation.


**First style**
```C++ 
return-type function-name(){
	//Some code here
}
```
<br>

**Second style**
```C++ 
return-type function-name()
{
	//Some code here
}
```
